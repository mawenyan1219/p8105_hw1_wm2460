P8105 HW 1
================

## Problem 1

#### Description of “penguins” dataset

The variable names of the penguins dataset are species, island,
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex,
year. This data set contains physical traits measurement information
about the different species of penguins in some islands.

There are 344 observations and 8 variables in this dataset.

The means flipper length is 200.9152047

#### Scatterplot

``` r
penguins_plot_df = tibble(
  x = penguins$bill_length_mm,
  y = penguins$flipper_length_mm,
  Species = penguins$species
)

ggplot(penguins_plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = Species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

## Problem 2

#### Data frame & mean calculation

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("High", "Low", "Low", "Medium", "High", "High", "Medium", "Medium", "Low", "Medium"))
)

problem2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1    1.96   TRUE        One      High      
    ##  2    1.18   TRUE        Two      Low       
    ##  3   -0.225  FALSE       Three    Low       
    ##  4   -1.80   FALSE       Four     Medium    
    ##  5   -0.570  FALSE       Five     High      
    ##  6    0.0366 TRUE        Six      High      
    ##  7    1.01   TRUE        Seven    Medium    
    ##  8   -1.26   FALSE       Eight    Medium    
    ##  9   -1.53   FALSE       Nine     Low       
    ## 10   -1.09   FALSE       Ten      Medium

``` r
mean(problem2_df$norm_samp)
```

    ## [1] -0.2298244

``` r
mean(problem2_df$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(problem2_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem2_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(problem2_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem2_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

In this dataframe, we can calculate the mean if the vector is numeric or
logical, and we cannot calculate the mean when the vector is character
or factor.

#### Convert variable & discussion

``` r
#Convert logical to numeric
convert_logical = as.numeric(problem2_df$vec_logical)

#Convert character to numeric
convert_char = as.numeric(problem2_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
#Convert factor to numeric
convert_factor = as.numeric(problem2_df$vec_factor)
```

Using thr `as.numeric` function, I was able to convert logical and
factor vectors into numeric vector. However, when I tried to convert the
character vector, I received the warning message saying
`"NAs introduced by coercion"`.

For the logical vector, the option is either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. So, R
can assign numeric value to these two options, and we are able to find
the means of the logical vector.

For the character vector, it is impossible to calculate the mean or
convert it to numeric and calculate the mean.

For the factor vector, since there are 3 “levels” in the dataframe, it
is possible to convert it into a numeric vector and calculate mean that
way.
